# Text Encryption and Decryption

A simple Java Swing application for text encryption and decryption using a Caesar cipher algorithm.

# How the key works?

- For encryption, each character in the input text is shifted forward in the alphabet by the key value.
- For decryption, the characters are shifted backward by the same key value to reveal the original text.

## Introduction
This Java application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to encrypt and decrypt text using a Caesar cipher. The user can input text, specify a key, and choose between encryption and decryption functionalities.

## Features
- Encryption of input text using a specified key
- Decryption of encrypted text using the same key
- Simple and straightforward UI

## Usage
1. Input the text you want to encrypt in the "Input Text" field.
2. Enter a numerical key in the "Key" field.
3. Click the "Encrypt" button to encrypt the text.
4. To decrypt, use the same key and click the "Decrypt" button.

## How to Run
To run this Java program:
1. Compile the `Main.java` file using a Java compiler.
2. Run the compiled program.
3. The GUI window will appear, allowing you to interact with the encryption and decryption functionality.

```bash
javac Main.java
java Main
```
